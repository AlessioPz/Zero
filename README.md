# Zero

In my experience as Android developer, starting a new project there are some steps done every time.
This because there are some fundamentals common in every project, piece of code that I copy and paste project by project.

This project, I named Zero, could be a starter, a template, for every project.
If you're a newbie, this project could be an interesting "pull-and-run" project in order to learn some fundamental.

Into Zero there are:

 * Menu - every project needs a menu, also for the reasons below.
 * Settings - almost one user preference value, also for the simplest app.
 * Privacy Policy - obligatory by law, I think every where in the world.
 * App version - a simply way to show the app version
 * Credits - you certainly don't wont to stay invisible :)
 * SQLite - probably a local database is not always needed, there are others way to save information locally, but I chose to write a simple database with only one table.
 
If you find some thing I missed, please let me know.

Good work to everybody.
